## About this Extension

This extension was developed so that agencies that use IAMResponding can use unattended systems.  The issue with IAR is that there is no automated login.  If the network has issues or something happens to the computer, which often does at most departments, the system would not automatically login to IAR, leaving the monitor that you rely on useless.

## Development

This extension was developed solely by me, but I no longer have an IAR login.  To repair any changes made by IAR or to make the extension better is near impossible.  That is why I am opening this up to other developers that want to play around with it.  I don't forsee a lot of changes made to it since it either works or it doesn't.  Agencies don't really need anything fancy, since the functionality is for it to keep the monitor logged in that host their IAR Alerts.
